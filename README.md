# Chalk it up!

## Description
Welcome to my climbing training log. It was built using a PHP and MySql back-end and a HTML/CSS front-end.

The app groups entries by date before displaying them since one day may have multiple training exercises. Due to time constraints of the sprint I was not able to include the Update and Delete functions of a full CRUD app and would like to in the future. 

In addition I would love to add a login system to allow multiple users to store their training logs simultaneously so I can share it with my climbing buddies.

## Dependencies
```
- PHP version 7.4.30
- MySQL version 5.5.5

```
## Installing 

Clone this repo:
```
  git@github.com:Harry-Johnston/Training-Log.git
```  
Install the database `training_diary_2022-08-01.sql` into a db named 'training_diary'

Ensure your local database host, username and password details are correct in: 
```
  
Providing you're running the PHP server, the application will now be available, bask in the coolness!
